# Boilerlink Email Extractor
A utility to export member emails from Purdue Boilerlink Club pages

Purdue Boilerlink is a great way for students to find clubs and get associated with clubs. However, it is currently not easy for a club president, treasurer, or any other club officer to access a list of registered members' email addresses for mass mailing purposes. This is a problem of concern since it is tedious for club officers to manually type in the email addresses of members to an email program such as Outlook.

This app will simplify the task of extracting emails found in Boilerlink. Simply open the app, log in (no login credentials are saved), and click *Extract Emails from page* to get all the emails found in the page. Additional emails that are copied to the clipboard can be instantly added to the list.

This program is written in VB.NET 2008 and can run on any computer with .NET Framework 3.0 or higher. Enjoy!
